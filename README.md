# Asteroid 14
## System-Wide Weather
The Spiritual Successor to Forecast and Meteor, Asteroid is here to keep you informed of the current weather conditions in style. Animated weather conditions are available on both the lockscreen and homescreen, so that you can always know what the current conditions are. Or, if you want to go for a more aesthetic device, you can customize what condition is displayed. Add a starry night sky to the background of your favorite lockscreen, or have a sunny day animation over your homescreen. The sky is the limit! Built with the Orion framework, Asteroid 14 is the next big step in device customization
